# What does this mod do?

This mod makes automated trains (NOT manual trains) automatically color themselves whenever they start moving on a path with an appropriate color based on the resource they're carrying. If a train is carrying more than one type of resource the color will blend appropriately (e.g. iron is blue, copper is red- carrying 50% iron and 50% copper will make the train purple)

- Colors
    - Coal: Black
    - Steel Plate: White
    - Iron Ore/Iron Plate: Blue-ish
    - Copper Ore/Copper Plate: Red-ish
    - Raw wood/wood: Brown

# (For developers) Compatibility

I have not added an API or support for any other mods, but if you would me to add an API let me know. Alternatively, you may contact me and let me know appropriate RGB colors (same as in game) for each of your resource types, as well as their internal name and I'll add them to the base mod.
